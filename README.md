# Meshfree_approximation_for_GW_PE
We (Lalit Pathak, Sanket Munishwar, Dr. Amit Reza and Prof. Anand Sengupta) developed a rapid parameter estimation method for gravitational waves (GW) using meshfree approximation. This is my master's thesis work and my contribution to the research paper on the method (https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.024053). The arxiv version of the paper is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07012. This repository is a demonstration of the method for binary neutron star events. In this repository, the parameter estimation (using meshfree approximation) codes for GW170817 and GW190425 are stored. Using meshfree approximation, the parameter estimation of GW170817-like events can be done in 2.4 minutes after detection, utilizing the 64 CPU cores on AMD EPYC 7542 CPU @ 2.90 GHz processor. This method can locate the source position in the sky within a few minutes and with good accuracy. Please take a look at the repository and codes. Please let me know if you have any suggestions or doubts.
